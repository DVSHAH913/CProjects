## Descriptions:

### Hotel Management Project

During my first semester, I created a hotel management system to ensure seamless hotel operations and consistent guest influx. The C code features a billing system for a luxury five-star hotel. It tracks customer stays, generates individual bills, and calculates final bills upon checkout.

### Car Brochure Management Project

In my second semester, I designed a project centered around a triple linked list implemented in C. This interactive program enables insertion, deletion, and navigation functionalities. It showcases car details and facilitates model exploration with intuitive navigation controls.

### Priority Queue Demo

Also in my second semester, I developed a project demonstrating the application of priority queues in a corporate context. Orders are prioritized based on factors like payment, where higher payment leads to higher priority. The project explores the concept of autonomous order priority management using technology.

### Graph Traversal Demo

As part of my exploration into fundamental concepts, I delved into graph structures and traversal algorithms. Specifically, I focused on Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) algorithms, essential tools for graph analysis.

### Implementing Traveling Salesman in C

In this project, I addressed the Traveling Salesman Problem, an intricate challenge requiring finding the shortest path to visit each node once. I employed a Greedy approach to optimize the path, assessing its efficacy in solving this complex problem.

Explore this portfolio to witness logical thinking and skillful application of C programming concepts.
